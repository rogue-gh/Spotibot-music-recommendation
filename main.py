# My program didn't rely on any numeric operators. Here's what they all do:
# a = 20
# b = 5
# + adds values together
# a + b = 25
# - subtracts values
# a - b = 15
# * multiplies values
# a * b = 100
# / divides the right by the left
# a / b = 4
# % returns the remainder after dividing the left by the right
# a % b = 0
# ** is the same as exponents
# a**b = 3200000
# // this is floor division, where the numbers after the decimal are removed.
# 7//2 = 3

# + when used with strings combines two variable together into one string
# b = " five"
# print("My favorite number is"+b)
# This returns: My favorite number is five
# * as a string operator is used to multiply the variable by the number given
# print("My favorite number is"*2)
# This returns: My favorite number isMy favorite number is
